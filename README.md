# secure-s3-bucket
Creating a AWS S3 bucket that is secure and private

# Purpose

We will be using this repo as a testing ground for running CI/CD with AWS CodeBuild.

Then we will intigrate Codepipeline

So everything inside cicd folder will potential be used inside the `aws-haris-sandbox` repo to implement CI/CD in that workflow instead of pulling the code locally and running terraform commands.

# test direct push to dev branch
